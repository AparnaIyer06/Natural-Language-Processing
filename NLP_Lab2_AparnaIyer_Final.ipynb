A heart attack and cardiac arrest (heart stopping) are two completely different problems...though a heart attack is a common cause of cardiac arrest. \\n\\nThe standard rule is 30 compressions to 2 breaths once you confirm there is no pulse (as she does when pressing his wrist). A pulse should ideally be confirmed centrally on the artery in the neck. \\n\\nThere is no strong evidence behind giving the two breaths so I don't blame her for giving compressions only. \\n\\nMy issue is the compressions are poor quality. They should be central on the chest with ALOT of force with fingers interlocked. Breaking ribs is a good sign of adequate compressions to illustrate how hard they should be. Instruction manuals will say depth of a third of the chest. Compressions should be done for at least two minutes after beginning before checking for signs of life again unless the patient jumps up at you and should be at 100-120 beats per minute. \\n\\n\\nThere theoretically isn't much harm in giving a sublingual aspirin (what she put under his tongue) except it could go down the airway (windpipe) and without blood circulation it will not have much of an affect...so giving CPR to start the heart (and getting an ambulance) is the only priority. \\n\\nIf he survived, the truth is he probably didn't have a cardiac arrest in the first place or his heart kicked in spontaneously because no way that level of compression is sufficient to restart circulation.

A heart attack and cardiac arrest (heart stopping) are two completely different problems...though a heart attack is a common cause of cardiac arrest. \\n\\nThe standard rule is 30 compressions to 2 breaths once you confirm there is no pulse (as she does when pressing his wrist).

They should be central on the chest with ALOT of force with fingers interlocked. Breaking ribs is a good sign of adequate compressions to illustrate how hard they should be. Instruction manuals will say depth of a third of the chest. Compressions should be done for at least two minutes after beginning before checking for signs of life again unless the patient jumps up at you and should be at 100-120 beats per minute. \\n\\n\\nThere theoretically isn't much harm in giving a sublingual aspirin (what she put under his tongue) except it could go down the airway (windpipe) and without blood circulation it will not have much of an affect...so giving CPR to start the heart (and getting an ambulance) is the only priority. \\n\\nIf he survived, the truth is he probably didn't have a cardiac arrest in the first place or his heart kicked in spontaneously because no way that level of compression is sufficient to restart circulation. \\n\\nAs mentioned in another comment success rates for CPR out of hospital are around 7% and drops further with age and the more medical illnesses a patient has.
